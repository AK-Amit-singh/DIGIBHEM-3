Internship Task Submissions


üîπ Task 3 Completed ‚Äì Snake Game in Python (GUI) üîπ

As part of my 6-week internship at Digital Bhem as a Python Programming Intern, I successfully completed Task 3, where I developed a fully interactive Snake Game using Python and Tkinter.

 What I Did:
 Created a game window using Tkinter and initialized the snake at the center.

 Implemented arrow key controls to navigate the snake in different directions.

 Added random food generation logic and made the snake grow upon eating food.

 Built collision detection to end the game if the snake hits the wall or itself.

 Integrated a scoring system that updates as the snake eats food, and displayed the score dynamically.

‚è∏ Included pause/resume functionality using the 'P' key for enhanced user control.

 I‚Äôve uploaded a screen recording that showcases the gameplay experience, from start to game over.
 

Outcome:
A classic Snake Game built with a smooth graphical interface, real-time key controls, dynamic score tracking, and robust game logic. This task helped me improve my skills in game development logic, event-driven programming, and Tkinter GUI design.
